          <a href="http://www.delillecellars.com/About-Us/The-DeLille-Chateau">DeLille Cellars Chateau</a>
          is located on the east side of Woodinville-Redmond
          Rd NE, across the street from the Woodinville Lavender farm.
          If you are coming from I-405, take exit 20 by Totem Lake
          heading east on NE 124th St. After 2.3 miles, turn left/north
          on Woodinville-Redmond Rd NE. The venue is on the right after
          1.2 miles.
        </p>

        <p>
          A note of caution: there are two other DeLille Cellars locations on most GPS services.
          One is the tasting room down the road in Woodinville and the other is the Maison DeLille wine lounge
          in Kirkland. Make sure you have the right address!

              On a stormy weekend in November, three days after Anne's birthday, we set off for an eventful trip to Lopez Island. The wind caused us to miss a flight and a charter boat. We met a taciturn Swedish boat captain who lectured us about Scandinavian hypocrisy and a taxi driver who told us stories of stolen dogs and scrap metal in a tobacco scented van. We stubbornly walked firewood from gas stations on two islands onto the ferry and back to our B&B so we could have the much anticipated first fire of the season.<br><br>

              We decided to spend our lives together in front of that fire. It was unrehearsed and heartfelt and very, very us.

              The next day, we missed the ferry from Lopez to Anacortes by one car. We called into work and spent the ensuing six hours of the unusually clear post-storm day wandering the beach at Odlin County Park and trying to put off the realization that wedding planning doesn't happen on its own.

            We recommend that guests stay in one of the towns adjacent to the venue such as Woodinville, Bothell, Kirkland or Redmond.
            If you are planning on staying in Seattle proper please account for extra time to arrive at the wedding as Seattle traffic is currently ranked fourth worst in the nation (right behind New York City).<br><br>

            We are currently working on room blocks, but the following hotels are of both high quality and close to the venue:
